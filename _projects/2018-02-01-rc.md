- This project aims to automate electrical appliances like lights, fans, etc. in a room according to the presence of humans.
- Most of the times we see there is a lot of power is being wasted such as when someone is leaving a room , the person may forget to turn off lights or fans in that room, or in public toilets all appliances like lights, exhaust fans, etc keep running throughout the day even we are using them or not.
- This kind of wastage is mainly seen in public places such that class rooms, hostels, corridors, public toilets, etc.
- This problem can be solved by having a mechanism, which can detect presence of humans in that area and accordingly turns on or off the electrical appliances
