The idea is to develop a simple software for segmenting various crucial regions of a human brain from the MRIs. Inspired by the very recent achievements of deep concatenated and residual neural networks in medical imaging on account of dominance over the traditional method which was possible with the advent of efficient Graphics Processing Unit(GPU) - accelerated networks, our proposal will be based on 2 pre-trained DNNs, one for brain MRI segmentation of brain fluids, and another one for tumors. The python libraries PyQT and PyQTGraph will be used for developing the GUI and visualizing the brain MRI images.
